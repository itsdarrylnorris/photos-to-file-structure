## Intro

**Photos To File Structure** is an opinionated folder structure to organize your media after exporting from the Photos app.

## Background

For many years, I used the Photos apps to organize all my media and browsers around my media. However, I ran into many issues, and I have decided to move away from the Photos app. Here is the list of the problems I ran into:

- **Backing up solutions:** The photos app works very well with iCloud to backup all your content. However, iCloud does not support more than 2TB worth of content, and it can only sync up with Apple products. In theory, I can just backup the entire Photos app, but this adds like 30% more storage, and it has a lot of unnecessary data, and I ran into issues trying to sync up all this data. Most importantly, if I make changes across multiple files, this will affect the Photo app database, which makes data syncing take a lot longer than it should be.

- **Unsupported Formats:** I recently purchased a Sony A7IV, and they do not fully support the Sony A7IV photos/ videos formats.
